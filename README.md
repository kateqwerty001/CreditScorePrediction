# Creditor Default prediction project (Supervised Learning - Binary classification)

In this project first of all we did EDA and preprocessed our data. 

Later, we have trained different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier) in order to predict the default (failure to make repayments on a debt) of a person, knowing their debt, salary, income, savings, spendings on different categories during the last 6 and 12 months etc. 

We also used XAI to analyze which features are more important to the model and which are less important.

In our project, we used AutoML techniques (TPOT and GridSearch) to obtain the best metrics possible.
